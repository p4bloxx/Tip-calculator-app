## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass (Preprocessor) for CSS [https://sass-lang.com/]
- SCSS syntax
- SASS variables
- Javascript

### What I learned

Hello everyone ;) this challenge was fun and helped me with my constant training in Javascript;

I ran into some difficulties along the way of course, and I wrote two versions of code(JS), both of which actually worked, but the first one was longer and contained some not-so-necessary code, so I've trimmed it all down and hope I've found a fairly coherent solution is useful.

### Continued development

My continuous development always focuses on Javascript, but without leaving behind the continuous evolution of HTML and CSS and being increasingly capable of finding scalable, efficient layout solutions with the right amount of code ;)
